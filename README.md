blankd
======

  **blankd** summoned for help with testing software which should do http requests
to http servers.

  **blankd** listens specified address and runs specified program on every
http request, program should serve that *http* request and output http
response like as following:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: Close
X-Custom-Header: Test


response body
```

  Note, you doesn't have to write all headers, you should write only additional
http headers, because **blankd** will automaticaly create all other standard
http headers, there is one important rule: after headers you should write two
line-breaks, if you want to send custom http status, then you must write it at
the first line.

  For your usability purposes **blankd** will create temporary directory for
every request with following structure:

```
.
├── _id          # unique identifier (generated by **blankd**)
├── raw          # raw request
├── method       # request method in uppercase
├── host         # request host from Host: header
├── uri
│   ├── raw      # raw request URI
│   ├── path     # URI path without query
│   ├── query    # URI query without path
│   └── values   # URI form values in 'key=value' format
├── headers
│   ├── raw      # raw request headers
│   └── values   # request headers in 'key=value' format
├── cookies      # request cookies in 'key=value' format
└── body
    ├── raw      # raw request body
    └── values   # request form values in 'key=value' format
```

  **blankd** will pass path to directory with request details as argument to
specified program.

  After running **blankd** you doesn't have to guess an answer to question like
'does it listening now?', because **blankd** will fork when starts listening
for a http connections, output new process pid to stdout and exit with zero
code.
